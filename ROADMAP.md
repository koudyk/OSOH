# OSOH Roadmap

## Milestones
### Milestone 1. Evaluate needs
We will begin by evaluating the needs of our target user group, neuroscience students in Montreal who've been introduced to open science. The goal is to assess what kinds of resources and support that trainees need. 

Tasks:
- [x] Contact relevant Montreal-based organizations to ask if they're planning to do a similar survey, and to ask if they want to collaborate
- [x] Design survey
- [x] Test survey
- [ ] Administer survey
- [ ] Analyze survey results

### Milestone 2. Create basic documentation
We will use the survey results to refine what our project is about. 

Tasks:
- [x] Revisit the vision statement
- [x] Create a code of conduct
- [ ] Create a diversity statement
- [ ] Create contributor guidelines
- [ ] Create a description of what the office hours could look like

### Milestone 3. Create website
Early on, we will create a website to increase our legitimacy and visibility for when we reach out to organizations for funding and open TA applications. 

Tasks:
- [ ] Choose website software (e.g, Hugo, ...)
- [ ] Create website with these pages
  - Home: vision, link to GitHub
  - Contributers: names, photos, links
  - Getting involved: TA application, contributer guidelines, code of conduct
  - Support Us: message to funders, link for receiving donations

### Milestone 4. Request funding
It is important to us that we obtain funding to hire Teaching Assistants to host the office hours, in order to increase the diversity of applicants.  

Tasks:
- [x] Create list of existing organizations who might contribute funding if we contact them.
- [ ] Create list of relevant official funding opportunities that we might apply for. 

## How to get involved
We are so excited that you are interested in OSOH! There are three main ways to get involved:

1. [Contribute to the project organization/infrastructure]() (*contributer guidelines coming soon*)
2. [Support us financially]() so we can compensate Teaching Assistants (*link to donation page coming soon*)
3. [Apply to be a Teaching Assistant]() to host OSOH (*application and guidelines coming soon*)
