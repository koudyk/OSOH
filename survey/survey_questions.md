# Potential survey questions


## Brief intro (or outro)
There are many components of open science, and it's important to remember that it's not all-or-nothing! Think of it like a buffet; you can come to the table and look for something to try, and then come back for more when you can. 

## Purpose 
In this survey, we want to find out what could help neuroscience grad students in Montreal do open science.

 Specifically, we'd like to know
- what you know about open science, 
- whether you're interested in doing open science, and
- what kinds of resources would help you do open science.

## Consent
