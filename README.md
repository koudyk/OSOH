# Open Science Office Hours (OSOH)

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to OSOH website! Note that this site is under construction. 

## Vision
Open Science Office Hours (OSOH) is an online space where **students can get regular help making their research more open**. Many grad students learn open-science skills at short events like summer schools and hackathons. But they may not have continuous in-lab support for using what they learn in their everyday research. We hope to support such students and integrate them into the open-science community so they feel empowered to do open science.

**Who is this for?**  In our first year, we're holding OSOH for **neuroscience graduate students in Montreal, Canada**. We may expand beyond this field and location in the future.

**Who are we?** OSOH started as a project in the [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) program. In line with our focus on open science, the organization of OSOH will be  **open and community driven**. We will hire more-experienced students to host OSOH as paid Teaching Assistants. We warmly welcome contributors! See our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/koudyk/OSOH/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and send us an [email](kendra.oudyk@gmail.com) if you're interested in working with us. 

We hope to begin OSOH in the **summer of 2021**, after Montreal's  [BrainHack School](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/). Check out our [Roadmap](https://github.com/koudyk/OSOH/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) to see where we're at in the project.
