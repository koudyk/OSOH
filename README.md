# OSOH
Open Science Office Hours

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 



## Vision
**What are we doing?** Open Science Office Hours (OSOH) is an online space where **students can get regular help making their research more open**. Many grad students learn open-science skills at short events like summer schools and hackathons. But they may not have continuous in-lab support for using what they learn in their everyday research. We hope to support such students and integrate them into the open-science community so they feel empowered to do open science.

**For who?**  In our first year, we're holding OSOH for **neuroscience graduate students in Montreal, Canada**. We may expand beyond this field and location in the future.

**With who?** In line with our focus on open science, the organization of OSOH will be  **open and community driven**. We will hire more-experienced students to host OSOH as paid Teaching Assistants. We warmly welcome contributors! See our [Contributor Guide]() and [Code of Conduct]() if you're interested in working with us. 

We will begin OSOH in the **summer of 2021**, after Montreal's  [BrainHack School](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/).
