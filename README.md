# OSOH
Open Science Office Hours


## Vision
**What are we doing?** We want to start Open Science Office Hours (OSOH) for neuroscience graduate students in Montreal. In this space, students could get regular 1-on-1 help making their research more open and reproducible. We will hire more-experienced students to host OSOH as paid Teaching Assistants. 

**Why are we doing this?** Many grad students learn open-science skills at short events like summer schools and hackathons. But they may not have continuous in-lab support for integrating what they learn into their everyday research.

**How will we do this?** In line with our focus on open science, the organization of OSOH will be  open and community driven. For specifics, see our [Roadmap](https://github.com/koudyk/OSOH/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).

**Where will this happen?** We will begin focusing on neuroscience graduate students in Montreal, Canada. OSOH will be online during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

**When will this happen?** We will begin OSOH in the summer of 2021, after Montreal's  [BrainHack School](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/).
